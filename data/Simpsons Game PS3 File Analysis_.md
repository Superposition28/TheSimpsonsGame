# **Analysis of File Types in The Simpsons Game (PS3) Extracted Data**

The PlayStation 3 game "The Simpsons Game" utilizes a complex file structure to organize its various assets and functionalities. Understanding the purpose of each file type within this structure is crucial for comprehensive game analysis, modding endeavors, and archival efforts. This report aims to dissect the file extensions found in the extracted game data, providing insights into their roles within the game's architecture. The analysis will focus on two primary directories derived from an initial extraction process: the original USRDIR and the subsequent QuickBMS\_STR\_OUTPUT directory, which contains files extracted from the game's archive files. The process of extracting game assets from archive files is a common practice in game development to manage large amounts of data efficiently and to optimize game loading times.1 The presence of both the original directory and the extracted output suggests a deliberate organization of game data, where archive files serve as containers for a multitude of individual assets.

## **Analysis of File Types in GameFiles\\Main\\PS3\_GAME\\USRDIR**

This section will examine the file extensions present in the USRDIR directory, which represents the core game files as they were originally structured.  
\#\#\#.snu Files  
The .snu extension is associated with a significant portion of the USRDIR data, accounting for 20.934% of its content and comprising 7,413 files identified as "Audio files". Research indicates that .snu files, particularly those with the .exa prefix (e.g., .exa.snu), are indeed audio files within the PS3 version of "The Simpsons Game".20 These files are typically found within the 'audiostream' folders of the game data.20 The audio within these .snu files utilizes the Electronic Arts EA-XAS 4-bit ADPCM v1 encoding at a sample rate of 48000 Hz, with a single channel and a bitrate of 228 kbps.20 A crucial finding is that the tool VGMStream is capable of converting these .exa.snu audio files into the more widely compatible WAV format using its command-line executable test.exe.20 This conversion capability is essential for users aiming to access or modify the game's audio assets. Furthermore, it has been observed that while video files with the .vp6 extension might play in media players like VLC, the associated audio often resides separately in .snu files.20 This separation suggests a specific method for handling audio streams during cutscenes or other video sequences within the game. It's also worth noting that the developer, EA Redwood Shores, might employ other proprietary audio formats, such as the MSB/MSX variant of MPF, for different audio elements within the game.23 The ability to convert .snu files using VGMStream highlights the community's effort in understanding and providing tools for accessing the game's audio data.

| Extension | File Type | Confirmed Purpose | Encoding | Potential Tools |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| .snu | Audio file | Background music/sound effects | EA-XAS 4-bit ADPCM v1 | VGMStream |

\#\#\#.str Files  
Another substantial portion of the USRDIR, occupying 20.215% of the data, is attributed to .str files, numbering 490 in total and labeled as "Archive files for assets, textures, and unknowns". Research confirms that .str files serve as the primary archives within "The Simpsons Game" for PS3.20 A specific script for the QuickBMS tool, named simpsons\_str.bms, is available to extract the contents of these archives.20 Upon extraction, these .str files reveal a variety of game assets, including 3D model files with extensions like .rws.PS3.preinstanced and .dff.PS3.preinstanced, as well as texture dictionaries denoted by the .txd extension.28 Further analysis indicates that .str archives can contain a broad range of assets, encompassing frontend textures used for the user interface, textures specific to individual game levels, textures shared across multiple levels, and potentially data related to the game's level geometry and cutscenes.29 The prevalence of .str files as the main containers for game data underscores their critical role in the game's asset management system. While Sony has used the .str extension for video formats in the PlayStation 1 era 30, its function as a general archive format appears to be dominant in this PS3 title. The availability of community-developed tools and scripts for extracting and handling .str files demonstrates the interest in accessing and potentially modifying the game's core assets.  
\#\#\#.vp6 Files  
The .vp6 extension accounts for 24.070% of the USRDIR size and is associated with 42 files identified as "Videos for pre-animated cutscenes". Research corroborates this identification, confirming that "The Simpsons Game" for PS3 uses .vp6 files for its Full Motion Videos (FMVs).20 The .vp6 format is a lossy video compression format developed by On2 Technologies, known as TrueMotion VP6, and is commonly used for web video and within Adobe Flash environments.32 It has been observed that while the video content of .vp6 files can be played using common media players like VLC Media Player, the audio track might not be directly supported.20 In such cases, the audio might reside in a separate file, potentially with a .snu extension, or it can sometimes be accessed independently using audio editing software like Audacity.20 For users requiring a more integrated experience, tools like ffmpeg can be utilized to losslessly copy the VP6 video stream into an MKV container while simultaneously converting the audio into formats like FLAC, which also resolves potential seeking issues with the original files.20 The use of the VP6 codec is not uncommon in games published by Electronic Arts 33, suggesting a standardization of video formats within the publisher's titles. The presence of .vp6 files in early prototypes of the game further confirms its intended use for the final pre-animated cutscenes.34

| Extension | File Type | Confirmed Purpose | Codec | Potential Tools |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| .vp6 | Video file | Pre-animated cutscenes | TrueMotion VP6 | VLC Media Player, Audacity, ffmpeg |

\#\#\#.mus Files  
A significant portion of the USRDIR, occupying 34.542% of the data, is attributed to .mus files. These 17 files are currently labeled as "Unknown". However, research strongly suggests that .mus files in "The Simpsons Game" for PS3 contain the game's music.26 This file extension is associated with audio data in various games, including titles from Electronic Arts on platforms like PS2, PS3, and PC, often for background music in series such as Need for Speed.36 In the context of the PS3, particularly for games developed by EA, .mus files might contain music organized into layers and segments, potentially utilizing the IMA ADPCM codec.26 While one source mentioned difficulty in accessing .mus files 20, other research indicates that conversion to more standard formats like WAV might be achievable using specialized tools and techniques developed for EA's .mus format in other games. For instance, a tutorial suggests renaming .mus files to .asf and using a specific tool for conversion.37 Furthermore, in the PlayStation 2 versions of the Jak and Daxter series, .mus files contain both music soundbank and sequence data (MIDI), which are then split into .mid and .bnk files on the PS3 versions.38 This suggests a potential structure for the .mus files in "The Simpsons Game" as well, possibly involving MIDI sequences and proprietary soundbanks.  
\#\#\#.lua Files  
A very small fraction of the USRDIR, just 0.001% of the size, is occupied by .lua files. These three files are correctly identified as "Lua source file". Lua is a lightweight scripting language commonly used in game development to define game logic, behavior, and user interfaces.20 In "The Simpsons Game" for PS3, Lua scripts play a significant role in managing the game's flow, including the sequence of gameplay and the triggering of cutscenes.55 Files such as simpsons\_gameflow.lua are responsible for building the game's structure, determining the order of episodes, maps, and movies.55 Additionally, Lua scripts handle the game's scoring system, with files like simpsons\_scores.lua managing various score types, events, and watchers.55 One notable aspect of Lua files is their accessibility; they are typically stored as plain text and can be opened and edited using standard text editors.20 This allows for potential modifications to the game's logic, offering opportunities for modding and deeper analysis of its internal mechanisms.  
\#\#\#.bin Files  
The .bin extension accounts for a small portion (0.238%) of the USRDIR data, with a single file identified simply as "BIN file". The .bin extension is quite generic, indicating a file containing binary data, and its specific purpose can vary greatly depending on the context.56 In the realm of video games, .bin files can serve various functions, such as storing ROM images for older consoles like Sega Genesis 60 or PlayStation 1 (often in conjunction with a .cue file).61 They can also be used for storing audio data within PS3 games, sometimes requiring specialized tools for extraction or playback.62 Furthermore, .bin files can represent raw data from a CD or DVD image.63 Without more specific information, the exact content and purpose of the .bin file in "The Simpsons Game" (PS3) remain undetermined. It might contain game-specific data, audio, or even parts of a larger archive or disk image. Analyzing the file's header using a hex editor or employing game-specific analysis tools could provide further clues to its function.65  
\#\#\#.txt Files  
A minuscule portion (0.000%) of the USRDIR is occupied by a single .txt file, labeled as "Text document". The .txt extension is universally recognized for plain text files. Given its minimal size, this file likely contains a small amount of human-readable information. This could include configuration settings for a specific game feature, log data generated by the game, or perhaps notes left by the developers. The content would be directly viewable and editable with any standard text editor.

## **Analysis of File Types in GameFiles\\Main\\PS3\_GAME\\QuickBMS\_STR\_OUTPUT**

This section will delve into the file extensions found in the QuickBMS\_STR\_OUTPUT directory, which contains files extracted from the game's .str archive files.  
\#\#\#.vfb Files  
The .vfb extension is associated with 8,770 files, accounting for 0.390% of the extracted data. The file type is currently unknown. Research into this extension in the context of PS3 games yields limited results. One possibility is that .vfb files are related to the game engine used, which is likely RenderWare. However, no direct confirmation of .vfb being a standard RenderWare format was found within the provided snippets. Another possibility, suggested by general file extension databases, is that .vfb might be associated with Visual FoxPro database files 66, but this seems unlikely in the context of game assets. Without further information, the precise purpose of .vfb files within the extracted assets of "The Simpsons Game" remains unclear. Further investigation, perhaps by examining the file headers or seeking information from communities specializing in RenderWare or PS3 game modding, would be necessary to ascertain their function.  
\#\#\#.preinstanced Files  
A significant portion of the extracted data, 40.562% and comprising 5,533 files, carries the .preinstanced extension and is labeled as "3D Assets". This suffix, when found on files extracted from the .str archives of "The Simpsons Game" (PS3), specifically indicates that these RenderWare files (likely with base extensions like .rws or .dff) contain compressed 3D assets.24 The .rws and .dff formats are associated with 3D models within the RenderWare engine. The .preinstanced designation suggests that these models are prepared for efficient instantiation and rendering within the game engine, with the compression likely serving to reduce the overall size of the game data and potentially improve loading times. To work with these assets, the initial .str archive extraction using QuickBMS is necessary, followed by the use of tools like Blender with a specific Simpsons Game plugin to handle the .rws and .dff formats.  
\#\#\#.ps3 Files  
The .ps3 extension is associated with 4,962 files, accounting for 12.351% of the extracted data. The file type is currently unknown. While the user's data lists these as individual files within the extracted archive, research indicates that the .ps3 extension is more commonly used to denote a folder containing the complete files for a PS3 game, particularly when dealing with emulators like RetroBat and Batocera.19 In that context, renaming a game folder with the .ps3 extension signals to the emulator that it contains a PS3 game, often originating from a Blu-ray disc. The presence of individual .ps3 files within the extracted .str archives suggests a different or more specific purpose within the game's internal structure. These files might contain specific types of asset data or metadata utilized by the game engine, perhaps to identify or manage particular chunks of data within the larger archives. Further analysis of these individual files would be needed to determine their exact function.  
\#\#\#.xml Files  
A small portion of the extracted data, 0.092% and comprising 2,617 files, carries the .xml extension with an unknown file type. The .xml extension is widely used for files containing structured data in a human-readable format. Research suggests that .xml files within the PS3 system are often used for storing configuration data related to the XrossMediaBar (XMB) interface and databases.68 In the context of "The Simpsons Game", these .xml files likely serve a similar purpose, potentially storing configuration settings for various aspects of the game, such as user interface elements, game parameters, or even structured game data. Their format as plain text XML would allow for relatively straightforward inspection and potential modification, provided the schema and purpose of the data are understood.  
\#\#\#.txd Files  
The .txd extension is associated with 858 files, accounting for a significant portion (26.034%) of the extracted data. These files are labeled as "Texture Dictionaries". Research strongly confirms this identification. .txd files in "The Simpsons Game" (PS3) are texture dictionary files that contain the texture data used by the game's 3D models.24 After the initial extraction of .str archives using QuickBMS, these .txd files can be further processed using the tool Noesis, often requiring a specific Python script (such as tex\_TheSimpsonsGame\_PS3\_txd.py) to properly interpret the file format and export the textures into standard image formats.24 These texture dictionaries can contain textures in various compression formats, including DXT1, DXT3, DXT5, and raw formats, indicating optimization for different types of graphical data used by the game engine. The ability to extract and view these textures is crucial for modding and asset analysis.  
\#\#\#.lh2 Files  
The .lh2 extension is associated with 594 files, accounting for a small portion (0.242%) of the extracted data. The file type is currently unknown. Research suggests that .lh2 files in "The Simpsons Game" (PS3) likely contain game text strings.69 The .lh2 extension bears a resemblance to .lha and .lzh, which are associated with the LHA archiving format, a popular method for file compression, particularly in older systems and games.70 The \-lh2- method is a specific compression algorithm within the LHA format.73 This suggests that the .lh2 files in the game might be compressed archives specifically containing the game's text data, such as dialogue, subtitles, and UI text. To access this content, specialized LHA decompression tools might be required, after which the text data could potentially be viewed or modified with standard text editors.  
\#\#\#.alb and.ctb Files  
The extensions .alb and .ctb are associated with smaller portions of the extracted data. .alb files account for 0.031% (529 files), and .ctb files account for 0.042% (528 files), with unknown file types. Research into .alb files in the context of PS3 games and game assets is limited. However, .alb has been associated with audio data (sound effects and music) in a Wii game.74 This suggests a potential, though unconfirmed, purpose for these files in "The Simpsons Game" as well. As for .ctb files, research primarily points to their use in AutoCAD as color-dependent plot style tables 75 or in 3D printing software like Chitubox.77 These uses are unlikely to be relevant to game assets in this context. Therefore, the purpose of .ctb files within the extracted data remains unknown and might be specific to the game engine (RenderWare) or a particular type of game data not readily identifiable through general file extension databases.  
\#\#\#.dat Files  
The .dat extension is associated with 435 files, accounting for 0.240% of the extracted data. The file type is unknown. As previously noted, .dat files are generic containers for various types of data.57 In the context of PS3 games, .dat files can be used for license information (LIC.DAT) 80, backup data (archive.dat) 83, or simply as containers for game-specific data.57 Given their presence within the extracted assets, these .dat files might hold configuration settings, game progress information, or other data structures proprietary to "The Simpsons Game" or the RenderWare engine. If they are archives, tools like QuickBMS with specific scripts might be needed to unpack them.58 Otherwise, further analysis using hex editors could help reveal their internal structure and purpose.  
\#\#\#.graph Files  
The .graph extension is associated with 425 files, accounting for 0.577% of the extracted data. The file type is unknown. The term "graph" in computing often refers to data structures representing relationships between entities. In game development, .graph files could potentially store scene graphs (hierarchical organization of game objects), AI navigation graphs, or flowcharts defining game logic or events.84 Without specific knowledge of the game's engine and data formats, the exact nature of these .graph files remains speculative. However, their extension strongly suggests they contain interconnected data utilized by the game's systems.  
\#\#\#.rcm\_b Files  
The .rcm\_b extension is associated with 346 files, accounting for a negligible 0.000% of the extracted data. The file type is unknown. The PS Dev Wiki lists .rcm\_b under its "Unsorted" file formats for the PS3.68 This categorization indicates that it is a file type found on the PS3 system but without a widely documented or immediately apparent purpose. Its function within "The Simpsons Game" remains unknown based on the provided information.  
\#\#\#.sbk Files  
The .sbk extension is associated with 156 files, accounting for a significant portion (15.300%) of the extracted data. The file type is unknown. Research suggests that .sbk files often contain sound data. In the Jak and Daxter series for PlayStation 2, .sbk files typically hold lower quality sound samples.89 Additionally, the extension appears in the context of the "SBK Superbike World Championship" game series 90, though the format might differ. A Reddit discussion also mentions attempts to decrypt and change .sbk audio files.95 Given the prevalence of audio-related findings for this extension in other PlayStation games, it is highly probable that the .sbk files in "The Simpsons Game" (PS3) also contain sound data, potentially lower quality samples used for specific sound effects or parts of the game's audio.  
\#\#\#.bsp Files  
The .bsp extension is associated with 113 files, accounting for 0.080% of the extracted data. The file type is unknown. The .bsp format is well-known in game development as the file extension for maps used by engines like Quake and Source (powering games such as Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike).9 These files typically contain the level's geometry, textures, entities, and lighting information, organized using a Binary Space Partitioning tree structure. While "The Simpsons Game" uses the RenderWare engine, the presence of .bsp files suggests that either a RenderWare plugin for handling this format was used, or that these files serve a similar purpose in defining the game's environments.  
\#\#\#.smb Files  
The .smb extension is associated with 99 files, accounting for 0.057% of the extracted data. The file type is unknown. Research into this extension in the context of game assets is limited. However, a forum discussion on ZenHAX mentions .smb files in relation to game models, specifically for skeletons, animations, shaders, and texturing.111 Additionally, the webMAN MOD Wiki mentions .smb in the context of the "rsxgl" plugin, which is involved in graphics rendering on the PS3.112 These findings suggest that the .smb files in "The Simpsons Game" (PS3) likely contain data related to the game's 3D models and their visual properties. It is important to note that .smb is also an abbreviation for the Server Message Block protocol used for network file sharing 113, but this is likely a coincidence in the context of local game files.  
\#\#\#.mib Files  
The .mib extension is associated with 89 files, accounting for 0.013% of the extracted data. The file type is unknown. Research suggests that .mib files in a game context often contain audio data. A user on the HCS Forum inquired about ripping audio from .mib files 124, and the documentation for the Foobar2000 component VGMStream indicates support for .mib files, potentially related to MIC or MIH audio formats.23 While .mib is also widely known as the extension for Management Information Base files used in SNMP for network management 126, this is unlikely to be the case for game assets. Therefore, it is probable that the .mib files in "The Simpsons Game" (PS3) contain audio data in a format that might be recognized by tools like VGMStream.  
\#\#\#.amb Files  
The .amb extension is associated with 58 files, accounting for 3.551% of the extracted data. The file type is unknown. Research indicates that .amb files are often related to audio. In the game Civilization III, .amb files might contain MIDI music or define sound events.130 Additionally, .amb is associated with Ambisonics, a surround sound format, where .amb files can be WAV files with a custom GUID.132 Notably, VGMStream also lists .amb as a supported extension.136 Given these findings, it is likely that the .amb files in "The Simpsons Game" (PS3) contain audio data, possibly for ambient sounds or background music, potentially in an Ambisonics format or a MIDI-based format.  
\#\#\#.uix Files  
The .uix extension is associated with 54 files, accounting for 0.360% of the extracted data. The file type is unknown. Research into this extension in the context of PlayStation 3 games is scarce. However, .uix is associated with UIX-Lite, a user interface modification for the original Xbox.137 It is also the extension for a UI library in Pygame (pygame-uix).140 These associations suggest that .uix files likely relate to the game's user interface elements, potentially containing layout information, scripts for UI behavior, or custom UI assets. Their use might be specific to the game engine or a particular UI middleware employed.

### **(No Extension)**

Files with no extension account for a very small portion (0.001%) of the extracted data, with 47 such files present. Research indicates that files without extensions in the context of PS3 games can serve various purposes. They might be related to system functionalities or specific game features.141 In some cases, they could be parts of split archives or contain game update data.16 Identifying the purpose of these files would likely require examining their file headers using a hex editor or employing file identification tools to determine their underlying format.65  
\#\#\#.imb Files
