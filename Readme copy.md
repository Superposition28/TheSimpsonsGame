# The Simpsons Game (2007) Asset Extraction Tool

## Overview

This project takes the files from the PS3 version of "The Simpsons Game" (2007) and converts them into formats usable for modern tools.

## Features

*   **Automated Initialization:** Sets up the necessary environment and tools for the extraction process.
*   **Asset Conversion:**         Converts extracted files (audio, video, textures, 3D models) into modern compatible formats.
*   "Initializes",                gets everything ready
*   "QuickBMS STR",               extracts content from STR archive files
*   "Rename Folders",             renames the main output folders to be more human-readable
*   "Flatten Directories",        flattens the directory structure
*   "Audio/Video Conversion",     converts audio and video files to a usable format
*   "Assets to Blender",          uses Blender to convert the assets to a usable format (.glb)
*   "Noesis TXD extraction"       extracts textures from the .txd files using Noesis, broken for now

## Getting Started


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and set up:

*   **Operating System:** only tested on Windows, should be possible on Mac/Linux with minimal changes
*   **PowerShell:** only tested on PowerShell 7.5.0
*   **.NET:** only tested on .NET 9.0.201
*   **dotnet-script:** needed for many processes to run
*   **QuickBMS:** [Download QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) as it's a core dependency.
*   **Noesis:** [Download Noesis](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91) as required for textures.
*   **Game Files:** You will need a copy of "The Simpsons Game" game files for the target platform.
*   **ffmpeg:** This is used for conversion of proprietary video .vp6 into (.ogv, or any others). from [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#libraries](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#libraries) or [https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
*   **vgmstream-cli:** Download [vgmstream-cli r1980](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/releases/tag/r1980). This is used for conversion of proprietary audio .snu into (.wav, or any others).
*   **WinRar:** Used by the initializer to automatically extract the ISO file.

*   **Blender:** Downloaded Automatically via the init script, from [Blender 4.0.2](https://download.blender.org/release/Blender4.0/). Blender 4.0 or older (down to 2.8) is required for the conversion to work.

## Setup

install all prerequisites

download this repo using the web or git clone
web select ``<> Code`` button then ``Download Zip``
open zip folder and copy contents of TheSimpsonsGame-main\ into your project folder

or using git clone
```pwsh
git clone https:\\
```

open ``Windows Powershell`` and navigate to the project folder
then run 
```pwsh
.\main.ps1
```

### Your likely to encounter this error
```pwsh
PS C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\Desktop\test> .\main.ps1
.\main.ps1 : File C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\Desktop\test\main.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is
disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
At line:1 char:1
+ .\main.ps1
+ ~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
```

### To fix this, you can temporarily or permanently change the execution policy:
# Option 1: Temporarily Allow Scripts (for current session only)

Run this in your PowerShell window as Administrator:
```pwsh
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

Then try running your script again:
```pwsh
.\main.ps1
```

This method is safe and doesn't change system-wide settings.

# Option 2: Permanently Allow Scripts (for current user)
If you want scripts to always run for your user:

```pwsh
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
if a message ``Do you want to change the execution policy?`` appears,
select [A] or [Y]

RemoteSigned allows local scripts to run, but requires downloaded scripts to be unblocked.

to unblock run 
```pwsh
Get-ChildItem -Path "./" -Recurse -Filter *.ps1 | Unblock-File
Get-ChildItem -Path "./" -Recurse -Filter *.ps1 | 
    ForEach-Object {
        if ((Get-Content $_.FullName -Stream Zone.Identifier -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) -ne $null) {
            Write-Host "Still blocked: $($_.FullName)"
        } else {
            Write-Host "Unblocked: $($_.FullName)"
        }
    }
```

Then try running your script again:
```pwsh
.\main.ps1
```

#### 🔐 Always be cautious when allowing scripts to run, especially if you're unsure of their source.
#### Never run random scripts from GitHub without reviewing them first. Always skim the contents to make sure it’s not doing anything sketchy.



## Usage

Place the QuickBMS files in `Tools\quickbms` and the Noesis files in `Tools\noesis\exe`.

The project initialization, asset extraction, and conversion process are automated through a main script. To start the process, run:

```pwsh
.\main.ps1
```

Then, select each option in order:

**[0] Run all scripts**  OPTIONAL

**[1] Initialize (PowerShell, `init.ps1`)**

This step ensures all programs exist. It generates `config.ini` and the `GameFiles\Main\` directory. It registers all programs needed in the config file to be accessed by subsequent scripts (currently, only the Blender script uses this). It extracts the ISO contents using WinRar into `GameFiles\Main\`. The ISO file should contain `\PS3_GAME\USRDIR\` and other unimportant files (`\PS3_UPDATE`, `PS3_DISC.SFB`).

**[2] Rename USRDIR Folders (PowerShell, `RenameFolders.ps1`)**

This renames the directories in the game's root folder, as their original names are not descriptive. There are two kinds of folders: Levels and Assets.

*   4 asset folders: video, audio, characters, frontend
*   18 Map folders: For some reason, a number of Game Levels are separated as more than one root Map folder.

**[3] QuickBMS STR (PowerShell, `str.ps1`)**

The game files are almost all stored in a proprietary archive folder format identified by `.str`. The `.str` extension is actually meaningless, a pattern for the RenderWare game files. The 490 STR files contain over 20,000 game files, so this step extracts these many files as a massive nested structure of folders.

**[4] Flatten Directories (PowerShell, `Flatten.ps1`)**

This slightly un-nests the STR output structure by combining folders. This step was made to fix errors with Blender not finding files in long paths, but even this only reduced the number of errors significantly.

**[5] Video Conversion (PowerShell, `4_Video.ps1`)**

Converts the weird video format to a less weird one.

**[6] Audio Conversion (PowerShell, `4_Audio.ps1`)**

Converts the weird audio format to a less weird one.

**[7] init Blender (C#, `init.csx`)**

Gets the Blender conversion process ready.

Due to the length of the directory structure, Blender often fails to locate the files. I needed a fix, so I created symbolic links (advanced shortcuts) to each file's folder instead of removing unnecessary folders from the structure. Even this only reduced the reduced number of errors.

Processes `.preinstanced` files in the nested structure and generates a 'map' of asset file paths. Creates duplicate directory structures for `.blend` and `.glb` files based on `.preinstanced` files. Copies a blank `.blend` template file into the blend structure matching the `.preinstanced` files. Creates symbolic links for `.preinstanced`, `.blend`, and `.glb` files at the root of the current drive. Saves the generated asset map to `asset_mapping.json`.

**[8] Blender Conversion (C#, `blend.csx`)**

Converts each `.preinstanced` asset into `.glb` using Blender 4.0. The plugin or script stops working with 4.4. Currently, only 5337 of 5533 assets are converted successfully; the reason for the failure is unknown.

**[9] Texture Dictionary extraction (C#, `init.csx`), (PowerShell, `copy.ps1`)**

Run option `9`, then, when completed, manually perform the following:

To extract the PNG files from TXD dictionaries:

1.  Ensure a copy of `Tools\noesis\tex_TheSimpsonsGame_PS3_txd.py` is present in `Tools\noesis\exe\plugins\python\`.
2.  Open `Noesis64.exe`.
3.  Click 'Tools', then 'Batch Process'.
4.  In the batch process window, set:

    *   Input extension: `txd`
    *   Output extension: `png`
    *   Output path: `$inpath$\$inname$.txd_files\$inname$out.$outext$`
5.  Enable Recursive.
6.  Click 'Folder batch' and select the `TMP_TSG_LNKS_TXD` folder located at the root of your drive, where the prior script was executed.
7.  Then click Export.

When complete, run option `10` in the main script menu, and all PNG files should now be in `TEXTURES_OUTPUT`.

# DO NOT USE THIS FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES OR DISTRIBUTE ANY EXTRACTED ASSETS WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS.
# NOTE: THERE'S NO CHANCE THEY WILL EVER GRANT PERMISSION

The Simpsons characters themselves are primarily owned by The Walt Disney Company.

Specifically, the characters were created by Matt Groening, and the television show "The Simpsons" was originally produced by Gracie Films and 20th Century Fox Television (which is now part of Disney Television Studios). Through its acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Disney now holds the primary ownership of the copyright and trademarks associated with The Simpsons franchise, including the characters.

While Electronic Arts (EA) created the specific digital representations of these characters as assets within "The Simpsons Game, PS3 and Xbox360" the underlying intellectual property rights to the characters themselves belong to Disney. EA had a license to use these characters and the Simpsons brand to develop and publish their game.

So unless you want to be sued by Disney and EA, don't distribute any extracted assets ever—not for free, for money, or for fun, not even to your friends. These all constitute copyright infringement and are illegal just about everywhere in the world.
