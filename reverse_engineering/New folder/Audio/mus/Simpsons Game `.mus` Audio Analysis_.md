# **Technical Analysis of the .mus Audio Stream Format in "The Simpsons Game" (PAL PS3 Version)**

## **I. Introduction**

### **A. Objective**

This report provides a detailed technical analysis of the proprietary .mus audio stream format utilized for background music playback within the PAL PlayStation 3 (PS3) version of "The Simpsons Game," released circa 2007\. The primary goal is to dissect the format's structure, identify the underlying audio codec and its parameters, and elucidate the function of key structural elements, thereby furnishing sufficient technical detail to guide the development of a functional decoder for these audio assets.

### **B. Context**

"The Simpsons Game" was developed by EA Redwood Shores (later Visceral Games) and Rebellion Developments, and published by Electronic Arts (EA). The .mus files under examination reside in the USRDIR/Assets\_1\_Audio\_Streams/ directory of the game's PS3 file system. The 2007 timeframe places this game early in the PS3 lifecycle, a period where developers often employed custom or semi-custom audio solutions, frequently based on variants of Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM) codecs optimized for console hardware. Initial analysis indicates the presence of at least two distinct subtypes within the .mus files, distinguishable by specific values within their headers. EA Redwood Shores was known for utilizing proprietary engine technology, including sophisticated audio systems, in its games from this era.

### **C. Significance**

The proprietary nature of the .mus format currently obstructs direct access to the game's background music for purposes such as modding, preservation, fan projects, or detailed audio analysis. Reverse engineering the format is essential to overcome this limitation. This report builds upon preliminary observations regarding the header structure, chunking mechanism, and the presence of specific byte sequences, aiming to provide a comprehensive and actionable description of the format.

### **D. Methodology**

The analysis presented herein is primarily based on static examination of the file structure inferred from the provided initial analysis and common characteristics of game audio formats. This involves interpreting header fields, analyzing recurring structural patterns and markers, and comparing these observations against known audio formats prevalent during the PS2/PS3 era, particularly those associated with Electronic Arts and the PlayStation platforms. Information derived from publicly available resources, including documentation and source code of audio libraries like FFmpeg and vgmstream which support various EA formats, as well as discussions within reverse engineering communities, informs the hypotheses regarding codec identification and parameter interpretation. The synthesis of these findings aims to construct a plausible model for decoding the .mus audio streams.

## **II. Header Analysis (Offset 0x00 \- 0x0F)**

### **A. Overview**

All analyzed .mus files commence with a fixed-size 16-byte header. This header serves as the primary identifier for the file's internal structure and is expected to contain critical parameters necessary for initiating the decoding process. The variations observed within specific fields of this header distinguish the two identified file subtypes, designated herein as Type 1 and Type 2\.

### **B. Field Breakdown**

* **1\. Bytes 0-3: Signature / File ID**  
  * *Observation:* This 4-byte field contains values that vary between individual .mus files.  
  * *Analysis:* The variability indicates this field does not function as a fixed "magic number" (like RIFF or MUSX) identifying the format class universally. Instead, it likely serves as a unique or semi-unique identifier for the specific audio asset within the game's resource management system. Potential functions include an internal asset ID used by EA's audio middleware (such as the Audio Event Management System, AEMS, known to be used at EA Redwood Shores), a hash derived from the filename or content, or a checksum. While potentially useful for linking the audio stream back to game logic or verifying file integrity, this field is unlikely to directly influence the core audio decoding algorithm unless it acts as a key or seed for decryption (though no encryption is suggested by initial analysis) or selects a highly specific, file-dependent decoding variant. The existence of tools for hashing string labels in this game suggests EA employed such techniques for asset identification. For the purpose of basic playback, this field might be treated as metadata.  
* **2\. Bytes 4-7: Unknown Variable Field**  
  * *Observation:* This 4-byte field contains an integer value that varies between files.  
  * *Analysis:* Standard audio file headers often use such fields to store essential playback information. Plausible interpretations for this field include:  
    * Total number of decoded PCM samples in the stream.  
    * Total file size in bytes, or the size of the audio data section excluding the header and potential padding.  
    * Offset to the beginning of the actual audio data stream, if it does not immediately follow the header.  
    * Looping information, such as the start and/or end sample index for background music loops. This is particularly relevant for BGM streams, and the concept of defining loop points is common in game audio formats.  
  * Determining the precise function requires correlating this value across multiple .mus files with varying lengths, durations, and potential loop structures. If it represents the total sample count, it provides a crucial termination condition for the decoder.  
* **3\. Bytes 8-11: Type-Correlated Field**  
  * *Observation:* This 4-byte field consistently holds the Little Endian integer value 15 (0F 00 00 00\) for Type 1 files and 11 (0B 00 00 00\) for Type 2 files.  
  * *Analysis:* This field serves as a primary differentiator between the two observed .mus subtypes and is critically important for selecting the correct decoding parameters or logic path. Its function is likely tied to defining the audio configuration, possibly in conjunction with the subsequent Type Suffix field (Bytes 12-15). Potential interpretations include:  
    * An identifier for a specific EA ADPCM codec variant (e.g., mapping to different versions within the EA-XAS family or the EA R1/R2/R3 series).  
    * An indicator related to the channel count or layout, although 11 and 15 are atypical values for direct channel counts (which are usually 1, 2, 4, 6, etc.). FFmpeg's handling of EA codecs shows channel limits can depend on the specific variant ID.  
    * An index or identifier referencing a predefined set of audio parameters (like sample rate, block size, ADPCM coefficient tables) used within EA's internal tools like AEMS.  
  * The specific values 11 and 15 are likely constants used within the game's audio engine to switch between different decoding setups.  
* **4\. Bytes 12-15: Type Suffix Identifier**  
  * *Observation:* This 4-byte field contains 78 01 32 00 for Type 1 files and 02 03 02 03 for Type 2 files.  
  * *Analysis:* This field acts as a secondary identifier, seemingly coupled with the Type-Correlated Field (Bytes 8-11) to fully specify the audio subtype. The structure of these suffixes offers clues:  
    * 78 01 32 00: Appears as a relatively arbitrary but specific sequence. It might represent a version number, a set of flags, or simply a unique magic number for the Type 1 configuration.  
    * 02 03 02 03: The repetition of the 02 03 pair is highly suggestive. This pattern often indicates parameters related to stereo audio channels (e.g., configuration flags or interleave parameters for Left and Right channels) or a repeating structural element. It might define an interleaving block size (perhaps 2 or 3 bytes/nibbles per channel?) or specify paired parameters for a stereo codec setup.  
  * These suffixes are crucial distinguishing features. Comparing these exact byte sequences against constants found in the source code of decoders for various EA formats might reveal their precise meaning.

### **C. Header Field Summary Table**

The following table summarizes the 16-byte header structure and the hypothesized function of each field for both identified types:

| Offset (Hex) | Size (Bytes) | Field Name | Observed Value (Type 1\) | Observed Value (Type 2\) | Hypothesized Function/Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0x00-0x03 | 4 | Signature / File ID | Variable | Variable | Per-file identifier (Asset ID, Hash, Checksum?). Likely metadata for game engine, potentially not essential for basic decoding. |
| 0x04-0x07 | 4 | Unknown Variable Int | Variable | Variable | Potential total PCM sample count, file/data size, data offset, or loop point information. Requires cross-file analysis to determine. |
| 0x08-0x0B | 4 | Type ID | 0F 00 00 00 (15 LE) | 0B 00 00 00 (11 LE) | Primary subtype identifier. Likely selects codec variant (e.g., specific EA ADPCM type) or a predefined parameter set (channels, rate, etc.). |
| 0x0C-0x0F | 4 | Type Suffix | 78 01 32 00 | 02 03 02 03 | Secondary subtype identifier, works with Type ID. 78 01 32 00 may be opaque ID/version. 02 03 02 03 strongly suggests stereo channel configuration/interleaving. |

## **III. Internal Data Structure and Framing**

### **A. Chunking Mechanism**

The available information strongly suggests that the .mus audio data is processed in fixed-size chunks of 64 bytes. This approach is common in game audio streaming, particularly from optical media or hard drives on consoles like the PS3, as it simplifies I/O operations and buffer management. However, fixed-size physical chunking presents challenges for decoding a Variable Bit Rate (VBR) stream, as logical audio frames (the smallest unit the codec processes) will generally not align perfectly with these 64-byte boundaries. This implies that either:

1. Audio frames can span across multiple 64-byte chunks, requiring the decoder to maintain state (like ADPCM predictors and step indices) between chunks.  
2. Each 64-byte chunk contains internal metadata or markers to delineate the actual amount of valid audio data within it, potentially followed by padding.

The 64-byte size might also be related to hardware constraints or optimal data alignment for processing on the PS3's Synergistic Processing Units (SPUs) involved in audio decoding.

### **B. VBR Encoding Implementation**

The format employs VBR encoding, meaning the number of bits used to represent a fixed duration of audio varies. In the context of ADPCM, VBR can be achieved in several ways: variable ADPCM frame sizes, adaptive block structures, or efficient encoding of silence/low-complexity segments. A critical aspect of decoding VBR streams is determining the boundaries of each logical audio frame. The .mus format must contain information allowing the decoder to ascertain how many bytes constitute the next valid frame or data segment. This framing information could be:

* A size prefix before each logical frame.  
* Implicitly defined by the codec's rules (e.g., standard PSX ADPCM uses 128-byte blocks encoding 112 samples).  
* Indicated by specific marker sequences within the data stream, such as the observed 0C 00 00 00\.

The interaction between the VBR nature and the fixed 64-byte physical chunking is a central challenge in understanding this format. If the underlying codec uses frames larger than 64 bytes (like the 128-byte frames mentioned for EA XAS v1), the 64-byte chunks might represent interleaved data (e.g., 64 bytes for the left channel followed by 64 bytes for the right channel, or smaller interleaved segments).

### **C. Padding (0x00) Analysis**

The observation of significant 0x00 padding within the data blocks further supports the model of variable-length audio data being stored within fixed-size 64-byte containers. This padding likely fills the remainder of a chunk when the actual audio data for that segment ends before the 64-byte boundary is reached. The location and extent of padding are crucial for parsing: Does it always occur at the end of a chunk? Is its presence signaled by the 0C 00 00 00 marker? Understanding the padding rules is essential to prevent the decoder from attempting to interpret null bytes as valid ADPCM data.

### **D. The 0C 00 00 00 Sequence (Value 12\)**

This 4-byte sequence (representing the Little Endian integer 12\) appears frequently within the .mus files, often positioned between segments of apparent audio data and subsequent 0x00 padding. Its variable frequency per file suggests its use is conditional. Evaluating its potential function:

* *Frame Delimiter:* Could mark the end of a variable-sized logical audio frame.  
* *Sync Word:* Less likely as a simple sync word due to variable frequency, though it might play a role in resynchronization after errors or seeks.  
* *Padding Type Indicator:* Could signal that the following bytes (up to the chunk boundary) are 0x00 padding.  
* *Silence Marker:* Unlikely, as ADPCM can typically encode silence directly, and a 4-byte marker seems inefficient for this.  
* *Metadata Marker:* Possible, but less probable given its position relative to padding.  
* *End-of-Data Marker (within chunk):* This appears to be the most plausible function. It likely signals the end of valid audio data within the current 64-byte chunk, indicating that the remaining bytes up to the chunk boundary should be ignored (treated as padding).

Its variable frequency can be explained if it is only inserted when a logical audio frame terminates *within* a 64-byte chunk, requiring padding to fill the remainder. If a frame perfectly fills a chunk or spans across the boundary into the next chunk, the marker might be omitted at that specific boundary. The value 12 itself might have a specific meaning (e.g., related to the number of bytes remaining or a specific state flag), but its primary role appears structural – delimiting useful data from padding within the fixed chunk structure. No relevant information regarding this specific marker in the context of EA audio or ADPCM was found in the provided sources.

## **IV. Codec Identification and Parameter Determination**

### **A. Candidate Codec Analysis**

* **1\. EA ADPCM Variants (General):**  
  * Given the developer (EA Redwood Shores), publisher (EA), platform (PS3), and era (2007), the .mus format almost certainly employs a variant of EA's proprietary ADPCM codecs. Libraries like FFmpeg and vgmstream document and support numerous EA ADPCM formats, including EA-XAS, EA R1, EA R2, EA R3, EA-EACS, EA Maxis XA, and others. These are the primary candidates.  
  * The EA-XAS family is frequently mentioned. Notably, one source describes EA XAS v1 as using a 128-byte frame size. This contrasts with the 64-byte chunking observed in the .mus files. This discrepancy might be resolved if:  
    * The .mus files use a different version of EA-XAS with a 64-byte frame structure.  
    * The 64-byte chunks represent interleaved stereo data, combining to form logical 128-byte frames (particularly plausible for Type 2 files with the 02 03 02 03 suffix).  
    * The 128-byte information pertains to a different game or context.  
  * The EA R1/R2/R3 variants are also possibilities.  
  * The Type ID (15/11) and Type Suffix (78 01 32 00 / 02 03 02 03\) fields in the .mus header are the most likely keys to identifying the specific EA variant and its configuration (e.g., mono/stereo, coefficient sets). It's plausible that EA's AEMS toolset customized or configured these variants for specific games.  
* **2\. PSX ADPCM (Sony VAG):**  
  * The standard ADPCM format for PlayStation 1 and 2, often carried over to PSP and PS3 due to hardware/software compatibility. It uses headerless 128-byte blocks (typically encoding 112 samples) with a fixed compression scheme per block.  
  * While technically feasible on PS3, the .mus format exhibits significant differences from standard VAG: a defined 16-byte header, fixed 64-byte physical chunking (vs. 128-byte logical blocks), and the presence of VBR indicators (0C 00 00 00 marker, padding). These structural divergences make standard VAG an unlikely candidate, although EA could potentially have used a modified VAG codec within their proprietary container structure. However, leveraging their own established ADPCM variants seems more probable.  
* **3\. Eurocom MUSX:**  
  * This format, associated with developer Eurocom, uses the .musx extension and acts as a container for various codecs like PSX ADPCM, IMA ADPCM, etc.. EA Redwood Shores did collaborate with Eurocom on a later title (*Dead Space: Extraction*), raising the possibility of shared technology.  
  * However, the .mus extension similarity is weak evidence. The specific header structure of the Simpsons .mus files, with its distinct Type ID and Suffix fields, appears more tailored to a specific EA implementation rather than the potentially more generic MUSX container. Unless EA heavily adapted the MUSX format, it's less likely than an in-house EA format.  
* **4\. Other Formats (Ogg Vorbis, etc.):**  
  * Some databases or tools might associate the .mus extension with other formats like Ogg Vorbis. However, Ogg Vorbis is a perceptual audio codec with a fundamentally different structure (using psychoacoustic modeling, variable-length packets in Ogg container) compared to the ADPCM-like characteristics observed here (fixed chunking, specific markers, likely simple differential coding). These alternatives can be confidently ruled out based on the structural evidence.

### **B. Determined Parameters (Type 1 vs. Type 2\)**

Based on the analysis, particularly the header differences and the likely EA ADPCM codec family:

* **Codec:** Both types are presumed to be variants of EA ADPCM (likely within the EA-XAS or related families). The specific variant and its internal parameters (coefficients, etc.) are determined by the combination of Type ID (15 or 11\) and Type Suffix (78 01 32 00 or 02 03 02 03).  
* **Channels:**  
  * **Type 2 (ID 11, Suffix 02 03 02 03):** The repeating 02 03 suffix strongly suggests a **Stereo** configuration. The 02 03 might relate to interleaving parameters or flags for the two channels.  
  * **Type 1 (ID 15, Suffix 78 01 32 00):** Lacking the paired structure of Type 2's suffix, this type is hypothesized to be **Mono**. Alternatively, it could represent a different multi-channel configuration, but mono is the most common counterpart to stereo in game assets.  
* **Sample Rate:** The exact sample rate (e.g., 32000 Hz, 44100 Hz, 48000 Hz – common rates on PS3) cannot be definitively determined from the static analysis provided. It might be:  
  * A fixed rate common to all .mus files in the game.  
  * Encoded within the Unknown Variable Field (Bytes 4-7).  
  * Implicitly defined by the Type ID (11 or 15).  
  * Stored in external metadata files not analyzed here.  
  * Further analysis (e.g., analyzing decoded output quality at different rates, dynamic analysis) is required. A default assumption might be 48000 Hz or 44100 Hz, common for console BGM.  
* **Output Resolution:** ADPCM codecs almost universally decode to 16-bit signed PCM samples. This is the assumed output resolution unless contrary evidence emerges.

### **C. Initialization Data**

Standard ADPCM decoding requires initial values for the predictor and step index (quantizer scale) for each channel. These values might be:

* Implicitly zero.  
* Defined as constants for the specific EA ADPCM variant being used.  
* Stored within the 16-byte header (potentially derivable from the Type ID/Suffix or the Unknown Variable Field).  
* Located at the very beginning of the audio data stream, immediately following the header. FFmpeg's source code shows initialization steps for various ADPCM codecs, sometimes setting default values or expecting them from container metadata or extradata. Correct initialization is crucial for accurate decoding of the first few samples.

### **D. Proposed Tables**

## **V. Synthesis: Decoding Process Model**

Based on the analysis, a potential decoding process for .mus files can be modeled as follows:

### **A. Parsing Logic**

1. **Read Header:** Read the first 16 bytes of the file.  
2. **Identify Type:** Examine bytes 8-15 to determine if the file is Type 1 (ID 15, Suffix 78 01 32 00\) or Type 2 (ID 11, Suffix 02 03 02 03). Store this type information.  
3. **Interpret Header Fields:** Attempt to interpret the value in bytes 4-7 (Unknown Variable Int), potentially as total sample count or loop information if its function is determined.  
4. **Initialize Decoder:**  
   * Select the appropriate EA ADPCM decoding algorithm variant corresponding to the identified Type (15 or 11). This may involve loading specific coefficient tables or setting flags.  
   * Determine the channel count (likely 1 for Type 1, 2 for Type 2).  
   * Initialize ADPCM state (predictor, step index) for each channel. This might use default values (e.g., zero) or values derived from the header or the start of the data stream, according to the specific EA variant's requirements.  
5. **Main Processing Loop:** Begin reading the rest of the file data in sequential 64-byte chunks.  
6. **Process Chunk:** For each 64-byte chunk:  
   * Determine the amount of valid audio data within the chunk. Scan the chunk for the 0C 00 00 00 marker sequence.  
   * **If Marker Found:** The valid audio data extends from the start of the chunk (or the byte following the end of the previous chunk's processed data) up to the byte immediately preceding the 0C 00 00 00 marker. The marker itself and all subsequent bytes up to the end of the 64-byte chunk should be treated as padding/ignored.  
   * **If Marker Not Found:** Assume the entire 64-byte chunk contains valid audio data. The logical audio frame likely continues into the next chunk.  
7. **Decode Data:** Pass the identified valid audio data segment(s) from the chunk to the selected EA ADPCM decoder function.  
8. **Handle Interleaving (Type 2):** If processing a Type 2 (Stereo) file, de-interleave the ADPCM data according to the format's specific method (byte/nibble/block level, potentially guided by the 02 03 pattern) before or during decoding for each channel. The 64-byte chunk size might relate directly to the interleave unit (e.g., 32 bytes per channel per chunk segment).  
9. **Manage State:** Ensure that the ADPCM decoder state (predictor, step index) for each channel is correctly maintained and carried over between chunks, especially if logical frames span chunk boundaries.  
10. **Output PCM:** Collect the decoded 16-bit PCM samples for each channel.  
11. **Loop Termination:** Continue processing chunks until the end of the file is reached or until the total number of decoded samples matches the count specified in the header (if Bytes 4-7 are determined to represent the sample count).

### **B. Handling VBR and Framing**

This model explicitly addresses the VBR nature by using the fixed 64-byte chunking as the physical I/O unit, while relying on the 0C 00 00 00 marker as the primary mechanism to determine the logical end of valid audio data within each chunk. This allows variable amounts of audio data to be represented within fixed-size containers, with padding filling the unused space. The absence of the marker implies data continuity across the chunk boundary.

### **C. Open Questions**

Despite this model, several aspects remain uncertain and require further investigation:

* The precise function and interpretation of the Unknown Variable Field (Bytes 4-7) in the header.  
* The definitive sample rate(s) for Type 1 and Type 2 files.  
* The exact EA ADPCM variant (e.g., specific version of EA-XAS or R-series) corresponding to Type ID 15 and 11\. While the family is likely, the specific implementation details (coefficients, subtle rule variations) might differ.  
* The exact interleaving method used for Type 2 (Stereo) files within the 64-byte chunks.

## **VI. Conclusion and Future Work**

### **A. Summary of Findings**

The .mus files from "The Simpsons Game" (PAL PS3) represent a proprietary audio stream format, highly likely based on a variant of Electronic Arts' ADPCM codecs. Two distinct subtypes (Type 1 and Type 2\) exist, differentiated by specific values in their 16-byte headers (Bytes 8-15). Type 1 (ID 15\) is likely Mono, while Type 2 (ID 11, with 02 03 02 03 suffix) is strongly indicated to be Stereo. The format employs Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoding managed within a fixed-size 64-byte chunking structure. A key structural element is the 0C 00 00 00 marker sequence, which appears to delimit the end of valid audio data within a chunk, preceding 0x00 padding. While the codec family and basic structure are reasonably established, the exact sample rate and the precise function of header bytes 4-7 remain undetermined from static analysis alone.

### **B. Decoder Feasibility**

The analysis provides a solid foundation for developing a decoder. The header structure, chunking mechanism, VBR handling via the marker, and likely channel configurations are sufficiently characterized to attempt implementation. The primary challenges lie in identifying the exact EA ADPCM variant and confirming the sample rate.

### **C. Recommendations for Implementation**

Developers aiming to create a .mus decoder should:

1. Leverage existing open-source implementations of EA ADPCM codecs found in libraries like FFmpeg and vgmstream as a starting point. Focus on variants like EA-XAS and EA R1/R2/R3.  
2. Implement header parsing to identify Type 1 vs. Type 2 and extract known/potential parameters.  
3. Implement the 64-byte chunk processing loop, including the logic to detect the 0C 00 00 00 marker and handle the subsequent padding correctly.  
4. Implement conditional logic based on the file Type for channel handling (Mono vs. Stereo) and potentially selecting different ADPCM coefficient sets or decoding rules if the EA variants differ significantly.  
5. Experiment with common sample rates (32000, 44100, 48000 Hz) during playback or conversion to determine the correct one by ear or spectral analysis.

### **D. Suggestions for Further Research**

To resolve the remaining ambiguities and achieve a fully accurate decoder, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Dynamic Analysis:** Utilize a PS3 emulator with debugging capabilities or a hardware debugger on a PS3 development kit to trace the game's execution flow when loading and playing .mus files. Observing the audio engine's parsing and decoding routines in real-time would provide definitive answers about header interpretation, sample rate, ADPCM variant, and state initialization.  
2. **Code Analysis:** Perform disassembly and reverse engineering of the game's executable code, specifically targeting functions related to audio streaming and decoding. This could involve identifying code associated with EA's known audio middleware like AEMS or custom routines. Tools and scripts developed for other aspects of this game might provide starting points.  
3. **Cross-Referencing:** Analyze audio formats from other contemporary games developed by EA Redwood Shores, such as *Dead Space* or *The Godfather II*, to identify potential similarities in header structures, chunking mechanisms, or marker usage, which could shed light on the .mus format.  
4. **Sample Analysis:** Obtain and analyze a broader range of .mus files from the game (different music tracks, potentially different game regions or updates if available). Comparing the Unknown Variable Field (Bytes 4-7) across files of known or estimated durations could help determine its function (e.g., sample count).
