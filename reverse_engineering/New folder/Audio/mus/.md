**Deep Research Request: Analyze Proprietary `.mus` Audio Format from "The Simpsons Game"**

**Context:**
This research focuses on the `.mus` audio stream files found in the `USRDIR/Assets_1_Audio_Streams/` directory of the PAL version (likely PS3) of "The Simpsons Game," developed by EA Redwood Shores/Rebellion Developments and published by Electronic Arts (EA) around 2007.

**Summary of Existing Analysis:**
* **Purpose:** Streamed background music files.
* **Header (16 bytes):**
    * Bytes 0-3: Unique per-file signature/ID.
    * Bytes 4-7: Unknown variable field (integer observed).
    * Bytes 8-11: Type-correlated field (Observed: `0F 00 00 00` (15) for Type 1, `0B 00 00 00` (11) for Type 2).
    * Bytes 12-15: Type suffix identifier (`78 01 32 00` for Type 1, `02 03 02 03` for Type 2).
* **Internal Structure:**
    * Uses Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoding.
    * Processed in fixed-size chunks (strong evidence for 64-byte chunks).
    * Contains significant `0x00` padding in blocks.
    * The sequence `0C 00 00 00` appears frequently as a structural element, often between data and padding, with variable frequency per file.

**Research Goals / Key Unknowns for Playback:**
1.  **Identify the specific audio codec(s)** used for Type 1 and Type 2 files. Is it related to known EA formats (like EA-XAS, variants of ADPCM, SNS/SPS), standard codecs, or entirely custom?
2.  **Determine the standard audio parameters:** Sample Rate, Channel Count (Mono/Stereo/Other), and output Bit Depth/Resolution for both file types.
3.  **Define the VBR frame structure:** How is audio data organized within the VBR blocks? How are frame sizes determined or indicated for the decoder? How does this relate to the 64-byte chunking?
4.  **Explain the precise function of the `0C 00 00 00` sequence:** Is it a frame delimiter, sync word, padding type indicator, silence marker, or something else?
5.  **Decode the meaning of Header Fields:** What do the values in bytes 4-7 represent? What audio configuration do the values 15 and 11 in bytes 8-11 correspond to (e.g., codec variant, channel layout)?
6.  **Identify any necessary initialization data or context** potentially stored elsewhere or implied.

**Potential Search Areas & Keywords:**
* Reverse engineering communities/forums (e.g., XeNTaX, ZenHAX).
* Game modding sites related to "The Simpsons Game" or other EA games of the era (PS2/PS3/Xbox 360).
* Technical documentation or SDKs related to PS3 audio hardware/software or EA audio middleware (e.g., RenderWare Audio, EA's internal engines).
* Source code analysis if any related engine code is available.
* Keywords: "The Simpsons Game" audio format, ".mus file format EA", "EA Redwood Shores audio engine", "PS3 audio streaming codec", "EA-XAS", "SNS SPS audio format", `78 01 32 00` audio, `02 03 02 03` audio, `0C 00 00 00` audio marker, "reverse engineering EA audio".

**Desired Outcome:**
A technical description of the `.mus` format sufficient to guide the development of a decoder, including codec identification, parameter definitions, frame parsing logic, and the role of key structural elements like the header fields and the `0C 00 00 00` sequence. Links to relevant specifications, tools, or discussions would be highly valuable.
