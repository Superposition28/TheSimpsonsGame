# **Analysis of the .xml.PS3 Binary Format in *The Simpsons Game* (PS3)**

## **1\. Introduction**

### **Objective**

This report presents a preliminary reverse engineering analysis of the .xml.PS3 binary file format, specifically examining the structure observed in the file loc\_igc11\_shot01.xml.PS3 originating from the PlayStation 3 (PS3) version of *The Simpsons Game*. The primary goal is to deduce the format's structure, identify key data elements, and hypothesize their function based on the provided file data and contextual information.

### **Contextual Background**

*The Simpsons Game*, released in 2007 and developed by EA Redwood Shores 1, utilized the RenderWare game engine for its PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.1 The filename loc\_igc11\_shot01.xml.PS3 and its associated path strongly suggest the file pertains to an In-Game Cinematic (IGC) sequence, specifically shot 01 of cinematic 11 within the "Land of Chocolate" level.1 The .xml.PS3 extension implies that this binary file is a compiled, platform-specific representation derived from an original XML source file, a common practice in game development for optimizing asset loading, parsing performance, or adapting data for specific hardware \[User Query\].

### **Key Markers & Initial Observations**

Initial examination of the provided hexadecimal data reveals distinct ASCII markers: seqm at the beginning of the file (offset 0x0000) and seqb at offset 0x0410 \[User Query\]. These markers serve as crucial identifiers for different structural blocks within the file. Furthermore, the target platform, the PlayStation 3, employs a Big-Endian byte order \[User Query\]. This architectural detail is fundamental for correctly interpreting multi-byte numerical values (such as integers and floating-point numbers) encountered during the analysis.

### **Methodology**

The analysis methodology involves a detailed examination of the provided hexadecimal data snippet of loc\_igc11\_shot01.xml.PS3. This byte-level analysis is correlated with contextual information, including the file's provenance (path and name), the known characteristics of the PS3 platform (Big-Endian), the specifics of the RenderWare engine used by the game 1, and relevant findings extracted from research regarding related file formats, community tools, and game structure.4

### **Report Structure**

This report proceeds by first establishing the file's context within the game's development and technical environment. It then delves into a detailed analysis of the identified structural blocks (seqm and seqb), interpreting header fields and data payloads. Subsequently, the relationship between these blocks and the potential overall file structure is discussed, considering influences from the RenderWare engine. A hypothesized format structure, including a detailed field table, is presented. The report then examines the potential integration with existing community tools and related file formats. Finally, recommendations for further, more comprehensive analysis are provided, followed by a concluding summary of the findings.

## **2\. File Provenance and Technical Context**

### **2.1. File Identification**

The full path provided for the file offers significant contextual clues:  
A:\\Dev\\Games\\TheSimpsonsGame\\PAL\\reverse\_engineering\\Source\\Extracted\\ps3\\xml\\Map\_3-01\_LandOfChocolate\\loc\\Story\_Mode\\Story\_Mode\_Design++sim\_Outside++loc\_igcs\\igc\_11\_folderstream\_str\\EU\_EN++assets++igcs++source++loc++loc\_igc11++shots\\loc\_igc11\_shot01.xml.PS3 \[User Query\].  
A breakdown of the path components reveals:

* PAL: Indicates the European region version of the game.  
* reverse\_engineering\\Source\\Extracted: Suggests the file was obtained through an extraction process from game archives, likely part of a development or modding toolkit structure.  
* ps3: Explicitly confirms the target platform.  
* xml: Hints at the original source format before compilation into the binary .xml.PS3.  
* Map\_3-01\_LandOfChocolate: Identifies the specific game level context, corresponding to "The Land of Chocolate" tutorial level.1  
* loc\_igcs: Denotes a directory related to In-Game Cinematics for this level (loc).  
* igc\_11\_folderstream\_str: Specifies cinematic sequence 11\. The folderstream\_str suffix is noteworthy, potentially linking this data to .str (stream) archive files, which are known to exist in the game and contain assets.4 Tools like simpsons\_str.bms exist for unpacking these .str files.4  
* EU\_EN: Specifies European English language/localization assets.  
* assets++igcs++source++loc++loc\_igc11++shots: Reveals a structured asset pipeline, likely reflecting the organization during development, moving from source assets to compiled game data.  
* loc\_igc11\_shot01: Pinpoints the specific file as data for the first shot of the eleventh cinematic in the Land of Chocolate level.

The detailed path confirms the file's precise role: providing data for a specific shot within an IGC sequence. It strongly supports the hypothesis that .xml.PS3 files are the result of a compilation process converting source XML data into a platform-optimized binary format for the PS3. The file's location within a directory named after a .str file (igc\_11\_folderstream\_str) suggests a functional relationship; the .xml.PS3 file might contain metadata, sequence logic, or parameters that control or reference assets packed within the corresponding .str archive for that cinematic. This compilation would occur during the game's build pipeline, transforming human-readable XML into a format efficiently parsed by the game engine on the PS3.

### **2.2. Game and Platform Specifics**

*The Simpsons Game* was developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts in 2007\.1 The PlayStation 3 version, relevant to this analysis, relies on the specific technical characteristics of the PS3 console. Critically, the PS3's Cell Broadband Engine processor utilizes a Big-Endian byte order \[User Query\]. This means that when multi-byte data types (like 32-bit integers or floats) are stored in memory or files, the most significant byte comes first. All interpretations of numerical data within the .xml.PS3 file must adhere to this Big-Endian convention.  
The game is known to be playable on PS3 emulators such as RPCS3, although sometimes requiring community-developed patches for stability or performance improvements.10 This indicates a degree of understanding of the game's execution and data within the emulation and modding communities, even if specific proprietary file formats like .xml.PS3 remain sparsely documented publicly.

### **2.3. RenderWare Engine Context**

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of *The Simpsons Game* were built using the RenderWare engine, developed by Criterion Software.1 Other platform versions (Wii, PS2, PSP) utilized the Asura engine.1 The use of RenderWare on the PS3 is further corroborated by community discussions and tools specifically designed for handling RenderWare assets (.rws, .dff model files) extracted from the PS3 version of the game.4  
RenderWare itself is a middleware solution known for its use of a binary stream file format.7 These files typically consist of a hierarchical structure of "chunks" or "sections". Each chunk is usually identified by a numeric type ID and contains data specific to that type.7 A common structure for RenderWare chunks includes a 12-byte header containing the chunk type ID (uint32), the chunk size (uint32, including header and data/children), and a library ID stamp (uint32, often encoding the RenderWare version).8 Standard RenderWare file extensions associated with different asset types include .rws (generic RenderWare stream), .dff (models, Dive File Format), .txd (texture dictionaries), .bsp (level geometry/maps), and importantly, .anm (used for animations and sometimes cutscenes in RenderWare-based games like Grand Theft Auto III).7  
Given that *The Simpsons Game* uses RenderWare on the PS3, it is highly probable that the .xml.PS3 format, while seemingly custom due to its name and ASCII markers, is influenced by RenderWare's architectural principles. The file might employ a similar chunk-based, hierarchical structure. The observed seqm and seqb markers could represent custom chunk types defined by EA Redwood Shores. While standard RenderWare uses numeric IDs, the use of ASCII tags is not unheard of in custom binary formats. The structure observed in the hex dump (seqm marker, followed by potential size and version/ID fields) loosely parallels the standard RenderWare 12-byte chunk header.8 This suggests the developers likely adapted RenderWare's core concepts of binary serialization and chunking but implemented a bespoke structure tailored for representing cinematic sequence data derived from XML. The existence of the .anm format for cutscenes in other RenderWare titles 8 provides a functional parallel, but the .xml.PS3 naming convention points towards a primary role in configuration, sequencing, or parameter definition rather than storing raw animation data itself.

## **3\. Analysis of the 'seqm' Block (Offset 0x0000)**

### **3.1. Identification and Header Analysis**

The file begins immediately with the 4-byte ASCII sequence 73 65 71 6D, which translates to seqm \[User Query\]. This marker unequivocally identifies the start of the first primary block or chunk within the file, likely representing the main sequence metadata or header.  
Following the marker, the subsequent bytes are interpreted as 32-bit unsigned integers (uint32) in Big-Endian format:

* **Offset 0x04:** 00 00 08 88\. Interpreted as a Big-Endian uint32, this value is 2184\. Its purpose is ambiguous based solely on this snippet. It could represent the total size of the seqm chunk itself (extending from offset 0x00 to 0x887), but the next identified block (seqb) starts much earlier at offset 0x410 (1040 decimal). Alternatively, 2184 might denote the size of data *associated* with this sequence but stored elsewhere, or perhaps an offset to a related data structure within the file or in memory. The visible padding (BB bytes) extends only to offset 0x40F. Comparing this value across multiple .xml.PS3 files would be necessary to clarify its exact meaning. For now, it is hypothesized to be a size field, but its scope remains undetermined.  
* **Offset 0x08:** 00 00 00 01\. Interpreted as a Big-Endian uint32, this value is 1\. This field commonly signifies a version number for the file format structure (indicating version 1 of the seqm block format) or potentially a count (e.g., indicating that this file defines a single primary sequence or contains one main set of properties).  
* **Offset 0x0C:** 00 00 00 10\. Interpreted as a Big-Endian uint32, this value is 16\. This value corresponds exactly to the size of the header fields analyzed up to this point (4 bytes for seqm \+ 4 bytes for size \+ 4 bytes for version/count \+ 4 bytes for this field \= 16 bytes). Therefore, it likely represents the size of this specific seqm header structure. Other possibilities include a count of data entries immediately following the header or a bitfield for flags, although header size seems most plausible given the value.

### **3.2. Data Following Header**

Immediately after the hypothesized 16-byte header, the data continues:

* **Offset 0x10:** 00 00 04 10\. Interpreted as a Big-Endian uint32, this value is 1040\. This value is intriguing because the subsequent block (seqb) starts at offset 0x410 (1040 decimal). The space between the end of this field (offset 0x13) and the start of the seqb block (offset 0x410) is filled with 0xBB bytes \[User Query\]. The size of this padding block is 0x410 \- 0x14 \= 0x3FC bytes (1020 decimal). Wait, the field is at 0x10 (size 4 bytes), so data starts at 0x14. The padding goes up to 0x40F. So the padding size is 0x40F \- 0x14 \+ 1 \= 0x3FC bytes \= 1020 bytes. The total size from 0x10 to 0x40F is 4 \+ 1020 \= 1024 bytes. The value 1040 (0x410) is slightly larger than this 1024-byte region. It might represent the size of an allocated buffer (1040 bytes), where the first 4 bytes are this size field itself, and the remaining 1036 bytes are intended for data, but in this instance, are mostly filled with padding (1020 bytes of 0xBB plus 16 bytes unaccounted for just before seqb). Alternatively, 1040 could be the offset to the *end* of this logical section, aligning with the start of seqb. Let's hypothesize it defines the size of the subsequent data/padding block, potentially indicating an allocation size of 1040 bytes starting from offset 0x10.  
* **Offset 0x14 to 0x40F:** BB BB BB... BB. This contiguous block consists of 1020 bytes, all set to the value 0xBB \[User Query\]. This pattern strongly suggests padding or reserved space. The use of 0xBB is less common than 0x00 (null padding) or 0xCC (often used by Microsoft compilers for uninitialized stack memory), potentially indicating a specific debug fill pattern used by EA's tools, deliberately placed padding for alignment, or simply uninitialized allocated memory that happens to contain this value.

### **3.3. Role Hypothesis for seqm Block**

Based on its position at the start of the file and the nature of its header fields (marker, size, version, header size, data size), the seqm block functions as the primary header for the entire .xml.PS3 cinematic sequence file. It establishes the file's identity, version, and overall structure, potentially defining sizes for subsequent data sections or allocating fixed buffers. The structure exhibits parallels with common binary chunk formats, including RenderWare's approach 8, although with custom identifiers and layout. The substantial padding block following the header suggests either fixed-size allocation strategies, alignment requirements for subsequent data blocks (like seqb), or space reserved for potential future expansion or data that is simply not present in this specific shot's file. The exact purpose of the padding and the precise interpretation of the size fields require further investigation across multiple file examples.

## **4\. Analysis of the 'seqb' Block (Offset 0x410)**

### **4.1. Identification and Header Analysis**

At offset 0x410, the 4-byte ASCII sequence 73 65 71 62 appears, translating to seqb \[User Query\]. This marker signifies the beginning of a subsequent chunk type, distinct from the initial seqm header. Given the context of a cinematic sequence, seqb likely represents a specific block, body, event, or command within the sequence timeline. A complete .xml.PS3 file might contain multiple seqb blocks following the initial seqm header.  
The header structure for this seqb block appears to be:

* **Offset 0x414:** 00 00 00 03\. Interpreted as a Big-Endian uint32, this value is 3\. This field could serve several purposes: it might be a type identifier classifying this specific seqb block (e.g., Type 3 corresponds to a camera manipulation command, an animation trigger, or a sound event), it could indicate a count of data elements contained within this block, or it might represent a bitfield of flags controlling the block's behavior.  
* **Offset 0x418:** 11 02 27 4A. Interpreted as a Big-Endian uint32, this value is 285368138\. The magnitude of this number makes its immediate interpretation difficult. Common uses for such values in game data include:  
  * A unique identifier, possibly a hash value, referencing a specific game asset (e.g., an animation name, object model, sound cue) or a named event. The existence of a hashing script (tsg\_hash.py) for string labels in this game 5 lends credence to this possibility.  
  * A timestamp or frame number within the cinematic sequence, potentially represented in a high-resolution format.  
  * A packed data structure, where the 32 bits encode multiple smaller values or flags.  
* **Offset 0x41C:** 80 00 00 00\. This 4-byte sequence has multiple interpretations depending on the data type:  
  * As a Big-Endian IEEE 754 single-precision float, it represents \-0.0.  
  * As a Big-Endian uint32, it is 2147483648\.  
  * As a Big-Endian int32, it is \-2147483648. The presence of 3F 80 00 00 (1.0 float) later strongly suggests this is also a float. Floating-point values are common in cinematic data for coordinates, rotations, scales, or timing. The value \-0.0 might be part of a vector or used as a specific parameter value.  
* **Offset 0x420:** 80 00 00 00\. Identical to the previous field, likely another float32 representing \-0.0. The repetition reinforces the possibility of vector or coordinate data.  
* **Offset 0x424:** 3F 80 00 00\. As a Big-Endian float32, this is the standard IEEE 754 representation of 1.0.  
* **Offset 0x428:** 00 00 00 00\. As a Big-Endian float32, this represents 0.0.

### **4.2. Data Following Header**

The sequence of four 32-bit values starting at offset 0x41C (-0.0, \-0.0, 1.0, 0.0) strongly resembles a 4-component vector or quaternion. Such structures are fundamental in 3D graphics for representing positions (X, Y, Z, W, where W is often 1.0 for points), rotations (X, Y, Z, W quaternion components), or potentially scaling factors or colors (RGBA). The data likely continues after offset 0x42B, containing further parameters specific to the seqb block type (Type 3, as hypothesized from offset 0x414).

### **4.3. Role Hypothesis for seqb Block**

The seqb block appears to encapsulate specific data elements pertinent to the execution of the cinematic sequence. The prominent use of standard IEEE 754 floating-point numbers is a strong indicator that this block contains numerical data related to 3D geometry, animation, or timing. Possible functions include defining camera positions or orientations, triggering object animations or transformations, specifying lighting parameters, or marking event timings. The field at offset 0x414 likely dictates the specific nature of the event or data (e.g., 'Set Camera Transform', 'Play Animation'), while the field at 0x418 could identify the target object or asset involved, potentially via a hash ID. The subsequent floats likely provide the core parameters for the event, such as transformation matrices, vectors, or timing values. The direct embedding of binary numerical data confirms the compiled nature of the .xml.PS3 format, optimized for direct consumption by the game engine.

## **5\. Relationship Between Blocks and Overall Structure**

### **Padding and Alignment**

The presence of the large, 1020-byte block of 0xBB padding between the end of the seqm header's initial data fields (at 0x13) and the start of the seqb block (at 0x410) is structurally significant \[User Query\]. Such padding is often introduced in console game development for performance reasons. It might serve to enforce memory alignment for the subsequent seqb block(s), ensuring that they begin at memory addresses optimal for the PS3's architecture (e.g., aligning to a cache line boundary or a specific memory page size). Alternatively, the seqm header might allocate a fixed-size buffer (potentially 1040 bytes as suggested by the field at 0x10) for sequence-related data, and this padding simply fills the unused portion of that buffer in this particular file. Determining the exact reason requires analyzing the alignment and size patterns across multiple .xml.PS3 files.

### **Sequence Structure**

Based on the observed markers and padding, the .xml.PS3 file format likely follows a sequential, chunk-based structure. It begins with a single seqm block that acts as a global header, providing metadata and context for the entire sequence. This is followed by one or more seqb blocks, each detailing a specific event, command, or data segment within the sequence timeline. The file effectively represents a stream of instructions or data points for the game engine to process in order to render the cinematic shot.

### **RenderWare Influence**

While the format utilizes custom ASCII tags (seqm, seqb) rather than the numeric IDs typical of standard RenderWare chunks 7, the fundamental structure (Marker \-\> Size/Type/Version \-\> Data) strongly echoes the design principles of RenderWare's binary stream format. EA Redwood Shores likely leveraged their experience with RenderWare or adapted its core concepts to create a custom binary format optimized for storing and processing cinematic sequence data derived from XML source files. This custom format allows for efficient parsing on the PS3 while potentially offering more direct mapping from the original XML structure compared to forcing the data into pre-existing RenderWare chunk types like .anm. The RenderWare .anm format, used for animations in games like GTA 8, might handle raw keyframe data, whereas .xml.PS3 seems geared towards higher-level sequence control, parameters, and event triggering, reflecting its XML origins. The modularity achieved through this chunked structure facilitates parsing, potential streaming, and modification of sequence events.

## **6\. Hypothesized .xml.PS3 Format Structure**

### **Overall Layout**

The preliminary analysis suggests the following high-level structure for .xml.PS3 files:

1. **seqm Chunk:** (Offsets 0x00 \- 0x40F, including padding)  
   * Header (Marker, Sizes, Version)  
   * Padding / Reserved Space  
2. **seqb Chunk 1:** (Starts at 0x410)  
   * Header (Marker, Type, ID/Timestamp)  
   * Data Payload (e.g., Floats, Integers, potentially Strings)  
3. **seqb Chunk 2:** (Would follow Chunk 1\)  
   * ...  
4. **(Potentially more seqb chunks)**

### **Proposed Header Field Table**

The following table summarizes the interpreted fields within the headers of the observed seqm and seqb blocks, assuming Big-Endian byte order. This structured breakdown facilitates understanding the binary data by translating raw hexadecimal values into potential data types and assigning hypothesized meanings based on common patterns in game file formats and the specific IGC context. It forms a foundational map for further reverse engineering efforts.

| Section | Offset (Hex) | Size (Bytes) | Hex Value (Big-Endian) | Decimal Value | Float32 Value | Potential Data Type | Hypothesized Meaning |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| seqm | 0x00 | 4 | 73 65 71 6D | N/A | N/A | ASCII String | Magic Number / Chunk ID for Sequence Metadata |
| seqm | 0x04 | 4 | 00 00 08 88 | 2184 | N/A | uint32 | Size field (Scope unclear: chunk size? related data size?) |
| seqm | 0x08 | 4 | 00 00 00 01 | 1 | N/A | uint32 | Version number? Count of sequences/properties? |
| seqm | 0x0C | 4 | 00 00 00 10 | 16 | N/A | uint32 | Header size (16 bytes)? Count of entries? Flags? |
| seqm | 0x10 | 4 | 00 00 04 10 | 1040 | N/A | uint32 | Size of following data/padding block (1040 bytes)? |
| seqm | 0x14 | 1020 | BB BB... BB | N/A | N/A | byte | Padding / Reserved Space / Uninitialized Data |
| seqb | 0x410 | 4 | 73 65 71 62 | N/A | N/A | ASCII String | Magic Number / Chunk ID for Sequence Block/Body/Event |
| seqb | 0x414 | 4 | 00 00 00 03 | 3 | N/A | uint32 | Block Type ID (Type 3)? Count? Flags? |
| seqb | 0x418 | 4 | 11 02 27 4A | 285368138 | N/A | uint32 | Asset Hash ID? Timestamp/Frame? Packed Data? |
| seqb | 0x41C | 4 | 80 00 00 00 | 2147483648 | \-0.0 | float32 / int32 | Float (-0.0) / Flags / Vector Component (X?) |
| seqb | 0x420 | 4 | 80 00 00 00 | 2147483648 | \-0.0 | float32 / int32 | Float (-0.0) / Flags / Vector Component (Y?) |
| seqb | 0x424 | 4 | 3F 80 00 00 | 1065353216 | 1.0 | float32 | Float (1.0) / Vector Component (Z?) |
| seqb | 0x428 | 4 | 00 00 00 00 | 0 | 0.0 | float32 | Float (0.0) / Vector Component (W?) |

### **Data Payloads**

Following the relatively fixed-structure headers, the seqb blocks would contain payload data whose format is dictated by the block's type identifier (the value at offset \+0x04 within the seqb chunk, e.g., 0x03 in the analyzed block). This payload could consist of additional floating-point vectors or matrices, integer parameters, string data (potentially length-prefixed or null-terminated), indices, or references (like hash IDs) to other game assets or entities required for the specific cinematic event defined by the block.

## **7\. Integration with Existing Tools and Formats**

### **Relevance of Existing Tools**

While no publicly available tools appear to directly parse the .xml.PS3 format, several tools developed by the modding community for *The Simpsons Game* on PS3/X360 might offer indirect assistance or relevant code examples:

* **QuickBMS and simpsons\_str.bms:** QuickBMS is a generic file extraction tool driven by scripts (.bms).16 The simpsons\_str.bms script is specifically designed to unpack the game's .str stream archives.4 Although .xml.PS3 is not a .str archive, examining the .bms script's logic 16 could reveal patterns in how EA handled headers, data alignment, or potential compression algorithms (like Zlib, used in some QuickBMS scripts 19) within the PS3 version's assets. The file path's reference to igc\_11\_folderstream\_str \[User Query\] strongly suggests that .xml.PS3 files likely operate in conjunction with assets contained within these .str archives, making the unpacker relevant for accessing related content.  
* **Blender Plugin (Simpsons-Game-PS3-Blender-Plugin by Turk645):** This plugin imports RenderWare models (.rws.PS3.preinstanced, .dff.PS3.preinstanced) from the PS3 game into Blender.4 Its Python source code 20 is potentially valuable because it must correctly handle PS3 Big-Endian byte order and parse RenderWare's chunk-based structure as implemented in this specific game. Studying how it reads multi-byte integers, floats, and navigates chunk hierarchies could provide practical code examples applicable to parsing the .xml.PS3 format.  
* **Noesis and Texture Plugins:** Tools and scripts exist for handling the game's texture formats (.itxd, .txd).4 Like the Blender plugin, the code for these tools (especially any PS3-specific .txd plugin 22) might contain useful examples of data type handling for the platform, though textures are structurally different from sequence data.  
* **tsg\_hash.py:** This script performs lookups for the game's string label hashing algorithm.5 This tool could be directly applicable and crucial for deciphering potential hash values found within seqb blocks, such as the 0x1102274A value at offset 0x418. Successfully reversing such hashes to known names (e.g., object names, animation names, sound cues, possibly found by analyzing extracted .lh2 string files 5) would significantly clarify the function of these data blocks.

### **Related Formats**

Understanding how .xml.PS3 relates to other formats used in the game is also important:

* **.str (Stream Archives):** These appear to be container files holding the bulk assets (models, textures, sounds, etc.) for levels or cinematics.4 The .xml.PS3 file likely acts as an orchestrator, referencing and controlling the loading, timing, and behavior of assets stored within a corresponding .str file.  
* **.lh2 (String Files):** These contain localized text strings for the game.5 While structurally unrelated to the binary sequence format, they might contain names or labels that correspond to hash IDs found within .xml.PS3 files.  
* **RenderWare Formats (.rws, .dff, .txd, .anm):** As discussed, RenderWare's general binary stream and chunking principles 7 provide a conceptual background. The .anm animation format 8 is functionally the closest standard RenderWare equivalent to cinematic control, but .xml.PS3's origin and apparent content (parameters, potential transforms) suggest a focus on sequence logic rather than raw animation curves.

The community's reverse engineering efforts seem to have primarily focused on extracting user-visible assets like models, textures, and strings. The underlying sequence control formats like .xml.PS3 appear less explored. Therefore, while direct parsing tools are lacking, the source code of existing asset extraction tools and the hash lookup script represent valuable resources for tackling the .xml.PS3 format, offering insights into data handling conventions specific to this game on the PS3.

## **8\. Recommendations for Further Analysis**

To achieve a more definitive understanding of the .xml.PS3 format, the following steps are recommended:

* **Comparative Analysis:** Obtain a diverse sample of .xml.PS3 files representing different cinematics, shots, and potentially different levels or game versions. Perform a byte-level comparison to:  
  * Identify fields with constant versus variable values across files.  
  * Determine the full range of possible values for type fields (e.g., the uint32 at offset 0x414 in seqb blocks).  
  * Clarify the exact meaning of size fields, particularly the 0x0888 value in the seqm header (offset 0x04) – does it correlate with file size, chunk size, or some external data?  
  * Analyze variations in the padding block – is it always 0xBB? Does its size change?  
* **Identify All Block Types:** Examine multiple files to discover if other chunk identifiers besides seqm and seqb exist within the format. Catalog any new block types found.  
* **Analyze seqb Payloads:** For each distinct seqb block type identified (based on the value at offset \+0x04), systematically map the structure of the data payload that follows the header. Look for recurring patterns, recognizable data structures (vectors, matrices, color values), string formats (null-terminated, length-prefixed), and further identifiers or references.  
* **Use Hash Lookups:** Employ the tsg\_hash.py script 5 to attempt reversing any suspected hash values (like 0x1102274A at 0x418) found in seqb blocks. Use comprehensive wordlists derived from known game strings, including object names, animation names, level names, character names, and potentially text extracted from .lh2 files.5 Successful reversal would confirm their function as identifiers.  
* **RenderWare Tools:** Utilize generic RenderWare analysis tools, such as RW Analyze 7, to inspect the .xml.PS3 files. While unlikely to fully parse the custom format, these tools might recognize the basic chunk structure (ID, Size, Version) if it adheres closely enough to RenderWare conventions, potentially identifying the seqm and seqb sections as custom chunks.  
* **Dynamic Analysis (Emulation):** Leverage a PS3 emulator with debugging capabilities, like RPCS3 11, for dynamic analysis:  
  * Identify the game code responsible for loading and parsing .xml.PS3 files. This can often be done by searching for the file extension or the magic numbers (seqm, seqb) in the game's executable code or by setting memory access breakpoints.  
  * Step through the parsing code in a debugger to observe how the game interprets each field in the file.  
  * Modify values within the loaded .xml.PS3 data in the emulator's memory (e.g., altering the floating-point values at offsets 0x41C-0x42B) and observe the resulting changes in the corresponding in-game cinematic. This can directly reveal the function of specific data fields (e.g., confirming they control camera position, rotation, or field-of-view).  
* **Adapt Existing Parsers:** Based on the hypothesized structure derived from static and dynamic analysis, attempt to modify existing Python code (e.g., from the Blender plugin 20) or create a new QuickBMS script 16 to automate the parsing and extraction of data from .xml.PS3 files. This would facilitate analysis of larger numbers of files.

## **9\. Conclusion**

### **Summary of Findings**

The analysis indicates that the .xml.PS3 file format, as used in *The Simpsons Game* for the PlayStation 3, is a custom binary format specifically designed for controlling In-Game Cinematic (IGC) sequences. It appears to be compiled from an original XML source, tailored for efficient processing on the PS3 platform. The format employs a chunk-based structure identified by custom ASCII markers (seqm and seqb), deviating from standard numeric RenderWare chunk IDs but likely influenced by RenderWare's binary stream principles.  
The initial seqm block functions as a global header, containing potential versioning and size information, followed by a significant padding block that suggests fixed-size allocation or memory alignment strategies. Subsequent seqb blocks encapsulate data for specific events or states within the cinematic sequence. The presence of Big-Endian IEEE 754 floating-point values within the analyzed seqb block strongly suggests it carries parameters related to 3D transformations (positions, rotations), camera settings, or timing crucial for cinematic playback.

### **Format Nature**

In essence, .xml.PS3 represents a proprietary, platform-specific (Big-Endian) binary format optimized for IGC sequence definition and control within the RenderWare engine environment as utilized by *The Simpsons Game*. It translates the descriptive structure of XML into a compact, directly parsable binary stream for the game engine, focusing on sequence logic and parameters rather than raw asset data like models or textures (which are likely stored in associated .str archives).

### **Next Steps**

While this report provides a foundational analysis based on the limited data available, a definitive understanding requires further investigation. The most promising avenues include comparative analysis across multiple .xml.PS3 files to identify patterns and variations, systematic reversal of potential hash identifiers using known game strings and the provided hashing script 5, and dynamic analysis through emulation to observe the game's parsing logic and the functional effects of data modification. These steps are essential to fully decode the structure and semantics of this custom cinematic sequence format.
