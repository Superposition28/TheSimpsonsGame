## 1. Overview

* **Format Name:** Custom Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) File
* **Common File Extension(s):** `.bsp`
* **Purpose/Domain:** 3D Game Level Data. Stores the spatial partitioning structure (BSP tree) and potentially other related level geometry data for a zone within the game. Used for efficient visibility determination, collision detection, and organizing level data.
* **Originating Application/System:** The Simpsons Game (Likely using a customized RenderWare engine)
* **Format Type:** Binary
* **General Structure:** File Header, Lump Directory, Variable Metadata Section, Main BSP Node Data (Lump 3), potentially other data lumps (Vertices, Faces, Textures, etc.), optional trailing data.

---

## 2. Identification

* **Magic Number(s) / Signature:** `0x0000000B`
    * **Offset:** `0x00`
* **Version Information:** The magic number `0x0000000B` might indicate Version 11.

## 4. Detailed Structure

**Section: File Header**

| Offset (Hex) | Offset (Dec) | Size (Bytes) | Data Type | Endianness | Field Name       | Description                                      | Notes / Example Value                       |
| :----------- | :----------- | :----------- | :-------- | :--------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `0x00`       | 0            | 4            | `uint32`  | BE         | Magic/Version    | File identifier, possibly format version         | `0x0000000B` (Maybe Version 11)             |
| `0x04`       | 4            | 4            | `uint32?` | BE         | Unknown          | Unknown purpose                                  |                                             |
| `0x08`       | 8            | 4            | `uint32`  | BE         | Metadata Count   | Controls structure/count of subsequent metadata  | Varies (6 in zone01, 1 in zone13)           |
| `0x0C`       | 12           | 4            | `uint32`  | BE         | Metadata Offset  | Offset from start of file to Variable Metadata   | `0x00000070` (Example from zone01)          |

**Section: Lump Directory**

*   **Location:** Starts at `0x10`, ends at `0x6F`.
*   **Description:** Acts as a directory containing entries pointing to various data chunks ("lumps") within the file. The exact structure is not fully decoded, but entries likely contain at least an offset and a size for each lump.
*   **Known Entry:** The entry at index 3 (file offset `0x30`) points to the start (Offset) and size (Length) of the main BSP node data chunk (Lump 3). Other entries likely point to vertices, faces, textures, etc.

**Section: Variable Metadata Section**

*   **Location:** Starts at the offset specified in `Header.MetadataOffset` (e.g., `0x70`).
*   **Structure:** Varies depending on the value of `Header.MetadataCount`.
    *   If Count is 6 (e.g., zone01), this section contains 6 identical-looking 16-byte blocks marked with `PE0`. Total size 96 bytes (`0x60`).
    *   If Count is 1 (e.g., zone13), this section contains different data (example bytes: `C8 FD CE AB...`).
*   **Purpose:** Unknown, precedes the main BSP node data.

**Section: Main BSP Node Data (Lump 3)**

*   **Structure Name:** `BSPNode`
*   **Count:** Determined by `LumpDirectory[3].Length / 64`.
*   **Location:** Starts at offset `LumpDirectory[3].Offset` (e.g., `0xD0` in zone01, `0x80` in zone13).
*   **Total Size per Record:** 64 bytes.
*   **Format:** 8 Floats, 8 Integers (all Big-Endian).

**Section: Trailing Data**

*   **Location:** Immediately following the last `BSPNode` in Lump 3.
*   **Presence:** Observed in some files (e.g., `zone01.bsp` has 16 extra bytes).
*   **Purpose:** Unknown.

---

## 5. Data Types Reference

*   **`float32`:** 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number, Big-Endian byte order.
*   **`int32`:** Signed 32-bit integer, Big-Endian byte order.
*   **`uint32`:** Unsigned 32-bit integer, Big-Endian byte order.
*   **`byte[N]`:** Fixed-size array of N bytes.
*   **`Leaf Node Data`:** When `ChildFront` and `ChildBack` are â‰¤0, the node is a leaf. Negative values likely encode a leaf identifier. The fields `Flags?` and `Unknown Int 4-8` then store leaf-specific data (e.g., properties like solid, empty, water, trigger, references to geometry). Exact encoding TBD. A (0, 0) child pair indicates a different type of leaf.

## 6. Checksums / Integrity Checks

* **Type:** None identified.
* **Location:** N/A
* **Scope:** N/A
* **Algorithm Details:** N/A

---

## 7. Known Variations / Versions

*   The primary observed variation relates to the `Header.MetadataCount` field and the subsequent Variable Metadata Section.
    *   **Count = 6** (e.g., `zone01.bsp`): Metadata section contains 6 x 16-byte 'PE0' blocks. Lump 3 starts at `0xD0`.
    *   **Count = 1** (e.g., `zone13.bsp`): Metadata section contains different, smaller data. Lump 3 starts at `0x80`.
*   **How to Differentiate:** Check the `uint32` value at offset `0x08`.

---

## 8. Analysis Tools & Methods

* **Tools Used:** Hex Editor likely used for initial inspection and data extraction. Reverse engineering tools and custom scripts (e.g., Python with `struct` module) would be useful for further decoding.
* **Methodology:** Comparison between different `.bsp` files (`zone01` vs `zone13`) to identify variable sections and fixed structures. Analysis of data patterns (floating point numbers, integers, offsets) to infer structure meaning.

---

## 9. Open Questions / Uncertainties

* Exact purpose and structure of the Lump Directory (`0x10`-`0x6F`).
* Exact purpose and structure of the Variable Metadata section (PE0 blocks / other data).
* Confirmation of plane normal normalization and exact definition of Plane Distance (Float 4).
* Purpose of BSP Node Floats 5-8 (BBox/Tex?).
* Meaning of BSP Node Int 1 (Flags?).
* Detailed encoding of leaf node data within BSP Node Ints 1, 4-8.
* Purpose of the 16 trailing bytes seen in `zone01.bsp`.
* Structure and content of other lumps presumably pointed to by the Lump Directory (Vertices, Faces, Textures, Collision, Entities, PVS data).

## 12. Other:

*   **Overall Purpose:** The BSP tree structure defined in Lump 3 allows the game engine to efficiently determine visibility (PVS), perform collision detection, and organize level data by associating spatial regions (leaves) with properties and renderable geometry.
*   **Missing Pieces (Likely in Other Lumps):** The complete level representation requires additional data beyond the BSP structure itself, expected to be in other lumps referenced by the Lump Directory:
    *   Vertex List (X, Y, Z coordinates)
    *   Face/Polygon List (Vertex indices, texture assignments, lighting info)
    *   Texture Information
    *   Collision Data (Specific collision meshes or properties)
    *   Entity Information (Spawn points, items, triggers, NPCs, etc.)
    *   Visibility Data (Precomputed Visibility Set - PVS, if used)
